# Python_Course
The objective of this course is :
  Introduce Python programming basics.
  Apply Python to basic statistical concepts.
  Provide hands-on practice with simple datasets.


## Course Outline:
1. Introduction and Setup (10 minutes)
  Objective: Set up the Python environment and give an overview of Python and its relevance to statistics.
  Materials: Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab), installation guide (if necessary).
  Topics:
    Why Python for statistics?
    Overview of libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.
    Introduction to Jupyter Notebook.

**Activity**:
  Ensure everyone can open Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
  Brief walk-through of the interface (markdown cells, code cells, how to run code).
  
2. Python Basics (15 minutes)
  Objective: Introduce basic Python concepts.
  Materials: Simple code snippets.
  Topics:
  Variables, data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans).
  Basic arithmetic operations.
  Lists and arrays with numpy.
  Importing libraries (import numpy as np).

**Activity**:
  Write simple Python code for basic arithmetic.
  Create and manipulate numpy arrays, such as calculating the mean of an array.
  
3. Introduction to Pandas and DataFrames (15 minutes)
  Objective: Introduce pandas and how to work with datasets.
  Materials: A small dataset (CSV format), such as a dataset with people's ages, incomes, etc.
  Topics:
  Reading CSV files.
  Creating and manipulating DataFrames.
  Accessing specific rows, columns, and performing basic operations like mean, median, and describe.
  
**Activity**:
  Load the dataset.
  Perform basic descriptive statistics using pandas methods.
  
4. Descriptive Statistics with Python (15 minutes)
  Objective: Learn how to calculate and interpret key descriptive statistics using Python.
  Materials: Continuation of the previous dataset.
  Topics:
  Mean, median, mode.
  Standard deviation, variance.
  Minimum, maximum, quartiles.
  
**Activity**:
  Use the dataset to compute and interpret these statistics (e.g., df.mean(), df.median()).
  
5. Data Visualization (20 minutes)
  Objective: Learn how to visualize data using matplotlib and pandas plotting capabilities.
  Materials: Continuation of the dataset.
  Topics:
  Basic plotting with matplotlib: histograms, bar charts, boxplots.
  Customizing plots (title, labels, colors).
  
**Activity**:
  Create a histogram of a numerical column (e.g., ages, incomes).
  Generate a boxplot to visualize the spread of data.

6. Inferential Statistics Introduction (10 minutes)
  Objective: Introduce the basics of inferential statistics and how to apply it in Python.
  Materials: scipy library for statistical tests.
  Topics:
  Introduction to hypothesis testing.
  Basic t-test, calculating p-value.

Activity:
  Perform a simple t-test using scipy.stats.ttest_ind() on a subset of the data (e.g., comparing two groups' incomes).
  
7. Wrap-Up and Q&A (5 minutes)
  Objective: Review key concepts and allow students to ask questions.
  Topics:
    Recap of Python basics, pandas, data visualization, and basic statistics.
    Additional resources for further learning.

Materials for the Lesson:
Software:
  Jupyter Notebook (local setup) or Google Colab (cloud-based).
Libraries to Install:
  numpy
  pandas
  matplotlib
  scipy
Datasets:
  A simple CSV dataset (e.g., people's ages, heights, and incomes).

-------------------------------------------------------------

Assessment (optional, if time allows):
  Ask participants to compute specific statistics on a new column.
  Task them with generating a specific plot and interpreting the result.
This layout covers essential Python skills while applying them directly to statistics, ensuring a solid introduction for beginners.
